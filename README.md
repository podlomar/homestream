   Or for development with auto-restart:

   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to:
   - `http://localhost:3000` (local access)
   - `http://[your-ip]:3000` (network access - the server will display your IP when starting)

3. The application will automatically scan your `/home/podlomar/Videos` folder and display all compatible video files

## Configuration

If you want to use a different videos directory, edit the `VIDEOS_DIR` constant in `server.js`:

```javascript
const VIDEOS_DIR = '/path/to/your/videos';
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

When a video is playing:
- **Spacebar**: Play/Pause
- **F**: Toggle fullscreen
- **Left Arrow**: Rewind 10 seconds
- **Right Arrow**: Forward 10 seconds

## Network Access

The server binds to `0.0.0.0:3000`, making it accessible from other devices on your local network. When you start the server, it will display the URLs you can use to access it from other devices.

## Security Note

This application is designed for local network use only. It serves files from your specified videos directory without authentication. Do not expose this server to the public internet.
