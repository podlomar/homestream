   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   Or for development with auto-restart:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to:
   - `http://localhost:3001` (local access)
   - `http://[your-ip]:3001` (network access - the server will display your IP when starting)

3. The application will automatically scan your `/home/podlomar/Videos` folder recursively and display all compatible video files organized by folder

## Configuration

If you want to use a different videos directory, edit the `VIDEOS_DIR` constant in `server.js`:

```javascript
const VIDEOS_DIR = '/path/to/your/videos';
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

When a video is playing:
- **Spacebar**: Play/Pause
- **F**: Toggle fullscreen
- **Left Arrow**: Rewind 15 seconds
- **Right Arrow**: Forward 15 seconds

## Controls

- **Mobile Touch Controls**: Tap the video to show overlay controls on mobile devices
- **Overlay Controls**: Hover over the video (desktop) or tap (mobile) to see convenient overlay buttons for play/pause, seeking, and fullscreen
- **Fullscreen Controls**: Overlay controls work perfectly in fullscreen mode with auto-hide functionality
- **Main Controls**: Use the buttons below the video player for the same functions
- **Large Video Player**: The video player takes up 85-92% of the screen height on mobile for optimal viewing
- **Touch-Optimized**: Larger touch targets and mobile-friendly button sizes

## Network Access

The server binds to `0.0.0.0:3001`, making it accessible from other devices on your local network. When you start the server, it will display the URLs you can use to access it from other devices.

## Security Note

This application is designed for local network use only. It serves files from your specified videos directory without authentication. Do not expose this server to the public internet.
